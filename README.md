# Resident Evil: True Director's Cut

Happy Resident Evil 25th Anniversary! On March 22, 1996, Capcom released in Japan the first game with the “Survival Horror” tag on the PlayStation: "Biohazard", and a a week later in the West as "Resident Evil". The game was a major success, selling over 2.75 million copies at the time.

Sadly, Resident Evil suffered from some questionable censorship. In 1997, the game received a Director’s Cut update, with many additions, including “the complete uncut and uncensored Resident Evil cinemas”, as stated on the back of the case. This was not the case, however, allegedly due to a "manufacturing error". When Capcom decided to re-release the game for a third time in 1998, featuring DualShock support and an orchestrated soundtrack. One might assume they finally fixed this issue but they did not.

This patch aims to restore content from various releases of the game, such as the Beta, Trial, or original Japanese versions, including:
- The original uncut FMVs from the Japanese version, alongside the full-color opening scene from the French and German Director’s Cut release.
- The Mansion’s Bathroom from the January 31, 1996 Beta version, allowing you to grab an extra Clip after unplugging the Water in Jill’s scenario.
- The Mansion's 2nd Floor Right Stairs wall message in blood, from the Japanese Trial Edition of the game.
- The Mansion's 2nd Floor Main Hall unknown music track, in the scene when Jill meets Barry again ("it's reeaally powerful"), sourced from the January 31, 1996 Beta version (only on Easy and Original modes).
- And more to come.

Further additions to this mod are in progress, including the restoration of background images from the memos present in the Japanese releases.

## Instructions
This patch is intended for the Greatest Hits DualShock Ver. release of the game. You should patch Track 1 only using xdelta. You have two patches to select from: one with the original OST and one with the Orchestral OST from the DualShock version.
